    """## Warp a montage to a template with image volumes using SDR.

    ### 💡 Note This is likely only applicable for channels inside the brain
              (intracranial electrodes).

    -----
    ### 🛠️ Parameters

    #### `montage : instance of mne.channels.DigMontage`
        The montage object containing the channels.

    #### `moving : instance of SpatialImage`
        The image to morph ("from" volume).

    #### `static : instance of SpatialImage`
        The image to align with ("to" volume).

    #### `reg_affine : ndarray of float, shape (4, 4)`
        The affine that registers one volume to another.

    #### `sdr_morph : instance of dipy.align.DiffeomorphicMap`
        The class that applies the the symmetric diffeomorphic registration
        (SDR) morph.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    -----
    ### ⏎ Returns

    #### `montage_warped : mne.channels.DigMontage`
        The modified montage object containing the channels.

    """## Make a volume from intracranial electrode contact locations.

    Find areas of the input volume with intensity greater than
    a threshold surrounding local extrema near the channel location.
    Monotonicity from the peak is enforced to prevent channels
    bleeding into each other.

    -----
    ### 🛠️ Parameters

    #### `montage : instance of mne.channels.DigMontage`
        The montage object containing the channels.
    #### `base_image : path-like | nibabel.spatialimages.SpatialImage`
        Path to a volumetric scan (e.g. CT) of the subject. Can be in any
        format readable by nibabel. Can also be a nibabel image object.
        Local extrema (max or min) should be nearby montage channel locations.
    #### `thresh : float`
        The threshold relative to the peak to determine the size
        of the sensors on the volume.
    #### `max_peak_dist : int`
        The number of voxels away from the channel location to
        look in the ``image``. This will depend on the accuracy of
        the channel locations, the default (one voxel in all directions)
        will work only with localizations that are that accurate.
    #### `voxels_max : int`
        The maximum number of voxels for each channel.
    #### `use_min : bool`
        Whether to hypointensities in the volume as channel locations.
        Default False uses hyperintensities.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    -----
    ### ⏎ Returns

    #### `elec_image : nibabel.spatialimages.SpatialImage`
        An image in Freesurfer surface RAS space with voxel values
        corresponding to the index of the channel. The background
        is 0s and this index starts at 1.
