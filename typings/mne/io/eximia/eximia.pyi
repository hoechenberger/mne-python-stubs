def read_raw_eximia(fname, preload: bool=..., verbose: Incomplete | None=...):
    """Reader for an eXimia EEG file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : path-like
        Path to the eXimia ``.nxe`` data file.
    
    preload : bool or str (default False)
        Preload data into memory for data manipulation and faster indexing.
        If True, the data will be preloaded into memory (fast, requires
        large amount of memory). If preload is a string, preload is the
        file name of a memory-mapped file which is used to store the data
        on the hard drive (slower, requires less memory).
    
    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the :ref:`logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        :func:`mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    Returns
    -------
    raw : instance of RawEximia
        A Raw object containing eXimia data.
        See :class:`mne.io.Raw` for documentation of attributes and methods.
